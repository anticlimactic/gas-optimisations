# A Repository of Gas Optimisations

## Motivation

A lot of Solidity optimisations are posted all over the internet. I have collected them and put them in a repository so you can see first hand how much gas you can possibly save with some of the optimisations listed within.

See SUMMARY.md for a list of gas optimisations, with a brief description of each one. See the file corresponding to the name of the optimisation in `src` for some insight as to how the optimisation works.
